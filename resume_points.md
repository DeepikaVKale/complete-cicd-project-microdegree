# Deployed applications on Amazon EKS 
1. Deployed applications on Amazon EKS by utilizing Ingress controllers for managing routing and traffic distribution to services, ensuring high availability and scalability in a microservices architecture.
2. Implemented AWS ALB (Application Load Balancer) Controller to automate the creation and management of ALBs, enabling efficient routing of HTTP/HTTPS traffic to Kubernetes pods.
3. Used eksctl to streamline the setup and management of Amazon EKS clusters, ensuring simplified cluster creation, management, and configuration.
4. Managed Git repositories for version control and collaboration on Kubernetes deployment configurations, Helm charts, and CI/CD pipelines.
5. Designed and implemented Kubernetes deployments for containerized applications, ensuring smooth rolling updates, scaling, and reliable deployments in the EKS environment.
6. Configured Ingress resources to enable external access to internal services running in EKS, ensuring seamless connectivity with the ALB controller for traffic management.
7. Integrated CI/CD pipelines to automate the deployment process, utilizing Git, Kubernetes, and AWS services for efficient development workflows and faster release cycles.
8. Optimized application routing and load balancing by tuning ALB settings for path-based routing, SSL termination, and WebSocket support, enhancing performance and security.
